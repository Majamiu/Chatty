# Chatty - lightweight and efficient clone of omegle.com

Chatty is based on Omegle.com. Omegle is randomly pairing you one-on-one with a stranger and letting you comfortably chat with him. Also, if you got bored by chatting with stranger, you can easily find other stranger to chat with. 

This clone might be not as good as it could be because I created it for learning purposes.
